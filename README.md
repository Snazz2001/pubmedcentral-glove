We all want to read a lot of research papers but do not have enough time. It is now possible to consider all the evidence in all the research papers written without much effort. You can confirm your hunch faster and proceed to invest more of your time on promising ideas.

This small Ipython notebook shows how to use Glove Algorithm to analyze PubmedCentral BioC Corpus with almost no effort.
Steps:
1. If you do not have python installed, download and install Anaconda to save time.
2. download and install glove-python from https://github.com/maciejkula/glove-python
3. download ascii.A-B.tar.gz and BioC.dtd from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/wilbur/BioC-PMC/
4. use command 'ipython notebook' to run the notebook
